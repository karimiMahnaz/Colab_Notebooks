YOLOv5 (You Only Look Once version 5) is a state-of-the-art object detection model developed by Ultralytics. It builds upon the original YOLO architecture with several enhancements for improved speed, accuracy, and ease of use. YOLOv5 is implemented in PyTorch, making it highly flexible and widely adopted for real-time object detection tasks.

Key Features of YOLOv5
Lightweight and Fast: Optimized for real-time performance with minimal computational resources.
High Accuracy: Provides strong detection results, balancing speed and precision.
Pretrained Models: Comes with pretrained weights for tasks like COCO dataset detection.
Ease of Use: Simple to train and deploy with detailed documentation and tutorials.
Flexible Scaling: Supports multiple model sizes (e.g., YOLOv5s, YOLOv5m, YOLOv5l, YOLOv5x) for different resource constraints.
Applications
Autonomous driving
Security and surveillance
